You can also watch this video of George Hotz from Comma.AI to learn about some of the drawbacks of behavioral cloning.

Note that the sample data provided by Udacity (see here) can also be sufficient on its own to train a robust model for Track 1.
Although you state that it didn't seem to help much, I personally found that simply using all 3 cameras and training with fewer 0 steering-angle samples was the key to building a successful model. (e.g., using Â±0.25 for the steering correction)


The model from comma.ai is another good architecture you could have used that works well for this behavioral cloning problem.

You could also try plotting a histogram of the training data to look for any unusual characteristics. For example, a distribution of the steering angles:
